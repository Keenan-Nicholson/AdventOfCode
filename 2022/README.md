day3: Finally, a reason to use ascii

day 4: AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH AAAAAAAHHHH HOW MANY TIMES CAN I MISREAD A QUESTION AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

day 5: ill do this later

day 6: very fun, also funny because this was supposed to be a break from studying networking and here I am doing a problem about packet and message sending
